# Comparing time series predictions of COVID-19 deaths

- Task 1: Preprocess the data using pandas to be ready for machine learning, and visualize the data using matplotlib
- Task 2: Create a SARIMAX model, optimize the model hyperparameters, use the model for forecasting future COVID-19 deaths and visualize the results
- Task 3: Create a prophet model and use the model for forecasting future COVID-19 deaths and visualize the results
- Task 4: Create a function that extracts features for training the XGBOOST and a feedforward neural network models
- Task 5: Split time series feature dataset into training and test datasets and perform data normalization
- Task 6: Train an XGBOOST model and a feedforward neural network model, and finally compare the predictions of all the models covered in the project
